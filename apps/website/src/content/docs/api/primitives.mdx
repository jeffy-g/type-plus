title: Primitives
---

TypeScript has a set of primitive types that are built-in to the language.
They are the building blocks of all other types.

[`type-plus`] provides a set of utilities to help you work with these types.

Each primitive type has an identifying util so that you can pinpoint them and process them specifically,
as well as a other utilities that are useful for working with them.
